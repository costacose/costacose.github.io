# About Me

This page will contain more details about me, my interests, and my journey.

Commit and push:

git add about.md index.md blog.md projects.md resume.md
git commit -m "Fix icon paths"
git push

Result:

    Now icons will load correctly on all pages, not just /.

    They will appear below the navigation bar.

Next (optional improvement)

If you prefer these icons only on the landing page, remove them from the other pages and just keep them on index.md.

Would you like me to:

    Keep them on every page (as you have now)?

    Or only show them on the landing page (cleaner, more standard)?

    Or move them into the menu bar (tiny icons next to links)?
